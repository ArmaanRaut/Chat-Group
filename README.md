# Chat@Group
A Multi-client chat server application which handles numerous clients chatting with each other using "Netcat" on different computers.

# Introduction
As the name suggest this is an application that lets one communicate with other users via local server using “netcat” in Windows. To elaborate a little the host system will act as a server to create a chat space in which other systems will go through steps to join and will be able to communicate.
* Not only the clients but also the server can chat in the created chat room.
* The whole group will be notified when someone connects or disconnect from the chat group.
